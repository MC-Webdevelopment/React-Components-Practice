# React components practice

Create the following user interface using React!

## Requirements
- Run ```npm install``` in the root directory of the folder to install the necessary modules. (This might take some time depending on your internet speed)
- Create the three components as seen in the image:
  1. Component for the ```<Title>```
  2. Component for the ```<List>```
  3. Component for a single ```<ListItem>```.
- Add the 3 ```<ListItem>``` as you see in the screenshot.

Bonus:
- You notice how using the ```<ListItem>``` component 3 times for the ```Eggs, Milk, Rice``` is not the ideal solution. What if we want to add more? If you finished early, use [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) page to learn about how you can go over arrays.
